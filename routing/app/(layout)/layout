Layout

Pages are route specific UI components

A layout is UI that is shared between multiple pages in your app

Think of it as a Header, Content, and Footer that always appear on the page

-- Create Layouts --
// Default export a React component from a layout.js or layout.tsx file
// That component takes a children prop, which next.js will populate with your page content
